<h2>Racism</h2>
<p><strong> Often put labels on people. He dresses like this so he must be into this music. She goes to that school so she must be rich. We can also stereotype people from different racial backgrounds as "lazy", "brainy", "aggro"you get the idea. The way to beat the stereotypes? Don't judge a whole group. Get to know people from different racial backgrounds and find out how much you have in common.</strong></p>
 <br>
 <h2><strong>Why people are racist</strong></h2>
 <p><strong>It's a question that people ask all the time. If we're all part of the human race, why are people racist? After all, there are no biological differences between people. No race is superior or inferior to another. We're all the same.</strong></p>
 <h2><strong>Environmental racism is a result of social, economic, and political factors that have created systemic inequities in the United States. </strong></h2>

<li><strong>Lack of affordable land: Corporations and governments often seek cheap land to build hazardous waste sites or dump toxic chemicals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lack of political power: Minority communities may lack political power and representation, making it difficult to fight corporations and the government.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unfair practices: Redlining and other unfair practices can force communities of color to live in areas with more environmental dangers and fewer resources.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intentional neglect: Minority and poor communities may be intentionally neglected.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Failure to enforce laws: State and federal agencies may fail to enforce environmental laws and regulations.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lack of monitoring: Pollutants that affect the air, soil, and water may not be monitored. </strong></li>
 </ul>
<h2>Why people discriminate on how people look </h2>
<p id="p"><i>Discrimination is when a person or group of people are treated badly or unfairly because of who they are. In many countries, including Australia, there are laws that say you can’t discriminate against someone because of where they're born, their cultural background, what they look like or the colour of their skin.</i></p>

<h2>4 Root Causes of Racism</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Many experts believe racist beliefs were developed to justify self-interest and greed. For almost 400 years, European investors enslaved people through the Transatlantic slave trade to support the massive tobacco, sugar, and cotton industries in the Americas. Slavery was cheaper than indentured servitude, so slavery was a business decision, not a reflection of hatred or bigotry.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Many say ignorance sparks racism, some of history’s most intelligent minds were behind racist ideas. Around the end of the 18th century, science replaced religion and superstition as the intellectual authority. In the way scientists started categorizing animals and plants, they also started categorizing humans. In 1776, German scientist Johann Fredrich Blumenbach classified humans into five groups, putting “Caucasian,” or “the white race” at the top. In the mid-1800s, Samuel George Morton posited that brain size was linked to intelligence. He concluded that white people had larger skulls and were therefore intellectually superior. While scientific texts were not widely available in this era, Morton’s ideas managed to spread in accessible publications, like cheap periodicals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Policies that discriminate by race reinforce racist beliefs. It sends a message to society that certain people, simply because of their race, don’t deserve the same treatment or opportunities as everyone else. Governments use a variety of justifications, such as natural security or public health, that many won’t ever question. It rarely matters if those justifications are at all based in reality.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Racism often persists because “keeping the peace” or maintaining law and order is more important than change. In his book Stamped from the Beginning, Ibram X. Kendi writes that racist ideas in America have long suppressed resistance to racial inequalities. When people believe racist things – like that Black people are naturally more violent and dangerous – they aren’t disturbed by police brutality or mass incarceration. They believe it’s justified.</strong></li>

<h2>Racism, bias, and discrimination</h2>
<p><strong><em>Racism is a form of prejudice that generally includes negative emotional reactions to members of a group, acceptance of negative stereotypes, and racial discrimination against individuals; in some cases it can lead to violence</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In 1619, when the first enslaved people were brought to what would become the United States, justifications for their enslavement were brought here too. In the 400 years since then, as those enslaved and their descendants have continued to call this country home, the justifications for their abuse and mistreatment have stayed with us as well.</em></strong></p>
<p><strrong><em>One of the most effective tactics used to justify anti-Black racism and white supremacy has been scientific racism. Through the years, scientific racism has taken many forms, all with the goal of co-opting the authority of science as objective knowledge to justify racial inequality.</em></strrong></p>
<p><strong><em>By the early to mid-20th century, polygenism and biology-based racism were widely disproven, and racism in social science had gained popularity. Studies showing high rates of imprisonment among Black Americans were used as proof of innate criminality, while pseudoscientific intelligence testing claimed the mental superiority of white people. These flawed, biased studies failed to account for political and social factors such as poor housing, poverty, lack of healthcare, and virulent racial oppression. But they provided the so-called evidence needed to fuel systemic forms of anti-Black racism, like segregation. And, for many Americans looking for objective reasons to justify racist beliefs and behaviors, studies like these were more than enough. Contemporary scientific consensus agrees that race has no biological basis, but scientific racism still exists. While it’s now more subtle than craniometry, its long history demonstrates the influence social ideas about race can have on supposedly unbiased research.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Some 19th-century scientists, like Harvard’s Louis Agassiz, were proponents of “polygenism,” which posited that human races were distinct species. This theory was supported by pseudoscientific methods like craniometry, the measurement of human skulls, which supposedly proved that white people were biologically superior to Blacks. Early statistical health data was weaponized against Black Americans in the late 1800s, as it was used to claim they were predisposed to disease and destined for extinction.</strong></em></p>
